;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; Package adds information about viewing progress of the media files
;; in DIRED buffer.
;; For now only mpv player supported.
;; 
;; Preparations:
;; Install mpv player. You can save position on exit manually using
;; "Shift-Q" shortcut, or add these lines to the mpv config:
;; 
;; keep-open=yes
;; save-position-on-quit=yes
;;
;; Optionally - install "mediainfo" app to display progress and "completed"
;; status.
